# API-scraping-Demo

This is the demonstration showing how the LinkedIn data breach has occured
It's done by using third party API scraping and retrieving data illegally
Here we are going to display the data on the localhost api endpoint.
And retrieval is done when there is no security.
And demo is done to show that there are errors when security measures like Authentication APIs ans Rate Limiting are implemented
